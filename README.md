## Growth Mindset

>*Growth mindset* is being able to look at challenges, speed bumps and setbacks, in a light that causes you to be able to push through to a **larger** version of yourself.

Some ways to keep in a growth mindset are
- Treat yourself with respect, the same way you would treat a friend that is struggling with a challenge.
- Try to realize that if you continue to chip away at an obstacle, you will eventually make it through it.
- Remember that it is difficult to learn new things, but over time with practice they will become easier.

I am Jonathan Ebanks. I am looking to change careers and I believe that coding would be a career that I could do well in.
